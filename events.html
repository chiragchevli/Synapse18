                            You’ve probably heard the saying that “Fashion is art.” And that is no more a truism than at
                            a fashion show. Fashion shows are not events that designers use to showcase what

                            you’ll be able to buy in stores the very next day.<br>

                            Instead, a fashion show is a chance for a designer to show off a
                            particular aesthetic, a particular mood, a particular feel or point of
                            view. As a result, fashion shows can tend to be more conceptual and
                            focused on a higher level idea where spectators enjoy the procession

                            of cutting-edge ensembles.<br>

                            This brings us to the theme of our event which is &quot;Films primés aux
                            Oscars”. As we all know Oscar-winning movies are the ones with the
                            best story, direction, and acting. All of which can also be
                            encompassed by a fashion show as these attributes also form an

                            integral part of a fashion show.<br>

                            When you dance, your purpose is not to get a certain place on the floor. It's to enjoy each
                            step of the way" ― Wayne Dyer
                            <br>

                            Dance is a form of expression through which you can find yourself in that moment and lose
                            yourself in the captivating beats all at the same time. From salsa to contemporary to
                            fusion, fasten your seatbelt, rock the stage and shake the world with your moves.

                            Taking pictures is savoring life intensely, every hundredth of a second. Life goes on, but a
                            photograph is a memento of that moment. A photograph has the ability to convey emotion,
                            mood, narrative, ideas, and messages – all of which are important elements of storytelling.
                            We celebrate photography as an art and provide you with the opportunity to compete with the
                            best in this genre and showcase your talent. Capture moments and make a story from them on

                            <li class="event-desc-modal-li">Right of Reply: A Representative whose personal integrity
                                has been violated by another Representative’s comments may exercise the Right of Reply.
                                Disagreement with the content of a Representative's speech is not grounds for a Right of
                                Reply. It is on the discretion of the Executive Board to recognize a Right of Reply as
                                well as decide on how to resolve the motion. This point may not interrupt a speaker but
                                should be addressed the moment he/she has finished his/her speech. Should the Executive
                                Board rule the Right of Reply out of order, his/her decision cannot be appealed. No
                                Representative may call for a Right of Reply on a Right of Reply.

                        <ul>
                            <li class="event-desc-modal-li">The Executive Board looks upon the concept of lobbying as
                                indispensable and places huge emphasis on a representative’s lobbying skills. A
                                representative may resort to following two forms of lobbying in the committee:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Direct Lobbying: Direct Lobbying implies the face-to-face open lobbying skills
                                        of a representative. Party Alliances, Bloc Formations, etc. are direct
                                        consequences of direct lobbying. To gain superiority, it is a must.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Backdoor Negotiation: As the name suggests, Backdoor Negotiation is a deviation
                                        from the conventional concept of lobbying. In a committee, individual policy
                                        plays a major role and being diplomatic in a situation that demands political
                                        prowess over staunch party policy, shall reap benefit for both sides being
                                        subjected to it. When a delegate feels that they need to go into a backdoor
                                        negotiation with another delegate, they may approach the Executive Board. One
                                        member of the Executive Board shall accompany the delegates party to the
                                        backdoor negotiation and follow the lobbying that takes place.

                                A written document, which is a set of Operative Clauses. Requires at least one sponsor
                                and three signatories, to be considered. If any particular Representative or party is in
                                disagreement with a specific clause of the Resolution, it may issue a 'Dissent Note' in
                                writing, addressed to the Executive Board.

                                A communiqué is a more informal and non-binding alternative to a resolution, intended
                                for common understanding of Committee and press Representatives.

                            </li>

                                could not be done through speeches, due to the limited time available. The Executive
                                Board may read out the statement to the Committee, if it deems fit to do so.

                                inform the Executive Board in advance.
                            </li>
                            <li class="event-desc-modal-li"> Memorandums:
                                A memorandum (memo) is written communication between a Representative and the concerned
                                branch of his or her political party ordering certain action to be taken. These shall be
                                strictly confidential in nature. Ironically, the same might be read out aloud in the
                                committee if the Chairs find it strategically or politically important at the given time
                                and circumstances. Memos must be clear cut and decisively framed. They would be rejected
                                if not found in the stipulated format or if the matter exceeds five lines. They should
                                be used to create favourable circumstances and hence advance one’s political interests.
                                It is important to use memos sensibly as they may backfire if not appropriately used.
                                They should not be detrimental to the political party the author belongs to or political
                                parties that are allies of the author’s political party. It is important that
                                Representatives understand the internal organization/structure of their political
                                parties to effectively use the same. Please note that for the purpose of this committee,
                                it is recommended that memorandums be routed through the Executive Board.
                                A sample Memorandum has been enclosed at the end of this document.
                            </li>
                            <li class="event-desc-modal-li">Outcome
                                The final document of this Meeting would be a consensual solution to the issue at hand,
                                in the form of recommendations to the Government. And for such document/s to be passed a
                                2/3rd majority of all the Representatives present and voting is necessary.
                                Unfortunately, Political Parties would not have an option to abstain, thereby requiring
                                them to come up with alternative voting strategies.
